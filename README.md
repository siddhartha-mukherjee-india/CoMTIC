# CoMTIC
It is a challenging NLP task to understand userâ€™s intent from code-mixed input. There is lack of available corpus for intent classification on code-mixed text. The technique for Intent Classification on Code-mixed text is not well explored. We introduce first of its kind Hindi-English dataset **Co**de-**M**ixed **T**ext for **I**ntent **C**lassification (**CoMTIC**) covering 10 most used intents for a Virtual Assistant particularly for Smart Phones.
